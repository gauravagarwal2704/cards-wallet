# Changelog

## [1.8.5+24] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Restyled “Buy me a Chai” to match the Coffee button more closely with a reduced corner radius and a chai cup icon.

## [1.8.4+23] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Updated the Chai support shortcut label to “Buy me a Chai” while keeping it beside the Buy me a coffee button.

## [1.8.3+22] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Replaced the custom Coffee shortcut with the supplied official “Buy me a coffee” artwork and kept Coffee and Chai side by side.

## [1.8.2+21] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Updated the Buy Me a Coffee shortcut with the requested “Buy me a pizza” label, pizza emoji, coral background, and white text.

## [1.8.1+20] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Coffee and Chai external contribution shortcuts on the supporter page alongside the Google Play Supporter Star options.

## [1.8.0+19] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- An optional supporter page, opened from the CardVault icon or Support shortcut in Settings, with localized Google Play Supporter Star products, three quick amounts, and a custom configured-amount picker.
- Repeatable consumable purchase handling for successful, pending, cancelled, and failed Google Play transactions. Each purchase adds one cosmetic Supporter Star while every functional feature remains available to everyone.
- Google Play tip product setup and testing guidance in `docs/google-play-tips-setup.md`.

### Changed
- Replaced the external Coffee and Chai payment shortcuts with the in-app Google Play Support flow.
- Updated the in-app and published privacy policy source to explain optional payment handling.

## [1.7.4+18] - 2026-10-10

### Changed
- Increased horizontal and vertical spacing between color theme tiles from 4 to 12 logical pixels, keeping the three-column layout.

## [1.7.3+17] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Debug and profile builds launch MainActivity directly, preventing Flutter from launching a disabled default icon alias after another icon is selected. Variant manifests remove launcher filters from icon aliases to avoid duplicate launcher entries. Release builds retain selectable launcher icons.

## [1.7.2+16] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Palette style comparison tiles generate distinct Tonal Spot and Expressive previews from the same base color rather than duplicating the device scheme. The section explains that Device colors retain the system style.
- Reduced Device colors padding/icon size, preset tile padding/label space, and preset grid gaps for a more compact layout.
- Widened the three-circle preview to include the entire final circle, with scaling for narrow tiles.

## [1.7.1+15] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Tonal Spot and Expressive appear side by side with labeled previews of button and tonal surface colors. Device color previews show the actual system scheme rather than the saved preset/custom seed.
- Color theme presets use three columns; selected presets, Device colors, and Custom color use filled highlights without colored selection borders.
- The Settings Appearance indicator reflects the active theme primary color after switching from a custom color to Device colors.

## [1.7.0+14] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Eight muted Material 3 color themes: Lavender, Sage, Dusty rose, Sand, Powder blue, Peach, Mist, and Olive.

### Fixed
- New installations default to Tonal Spot. Returning users retain their saved palette styles and prior appearance choices.
- Device colors read Android 12+ system tonal palettes and Android 14+ color roles rather than continuing to generate colors from the previous preset. The palette refreshes on selection and app resume, applies to light/dark/OLED themes, and uses a disclosed Indigo fallback when unavailable.

## [1.6.0+13] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Edit action in the left-swipe tray opens the existing card editor after the protected-edit authentication check and refreshes the wallet after saving.

### Changed
- Swipe actions are transparent circular outline buttons: Share uses the theme primary color, Delete uses the theme error red, and Edit uses the app's blue info color. All three fit together on smaller cards.

## [1.5.2+12] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Card swipe action buttons and their shadows now use the app theme primary color instead of fixed blue and red. Icons and labels use the matching theme foreground color.

## [1.5.1+11] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Custom-image overlay controls now use a filled selected state and a transparent, outlined deselected state.
- Hidden card overlays keep their layout slots so toggling logos, names, numbers, or dates does not move other elements in card previews, details, wallet tiles, or carousels. Hidden content remains excluded from painting and accessibility.
- Card numbers scale down on narrow previews to stay on one line.

## [1.5.0+10] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Show/hide controls for network logo, bank logo, contactless symbol, card type, nickname, card number, cardholder name, and expiry date when using a custom card image. Previews update immediately.
- Per-card overlay visibility persists across editing, wallet views, card details, and backup/restore. Existing cards keep all overlays visible, and catalog/gradient backgrounds retain their standard layout.

## [1.4.0+9] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Custom card image alignment with dragging, pinch zoom, a zoom slider, and reset. The live preview includes the entered card number.
- Saved image placement shared by add/edit previews, wallet views, card details, and backup/restore. Existing images default to their original centered crop.

### Fixed
- Removed the bank-colored shadow and underlying bank gradient from custom image backgrounds; images fill the card edge to edge.

## [1.3.0+8] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Change history in Settings → About, showing dated release notes and build numbers.
- A project rule requiring version bumps based on change magnitude and matching in-app and repository records for every completed app change.

### Fixed
- Returning to the home page within the app no longer prompts for another unlock. App lock uses a two-minute grace period after leaving the app.
- Android's native card scanner keeps the current app session unlocked, allowing scan results to open the card editor for review and saving.

## [Enhanced] - 2025-01-01

### 🎯 Major Enhancements

#### RuPay Card Support
- ✅ Added RuPay card detection with priority-based prefix matching
- ✅ Supports RuPay prefixes: 60, 6521, 6522, 607, 608
- ✅ Added RuPay AIDs: `A0000005241010` (standard), `A000000524` (domestic)

#### Multiple AID Support
- ✅ Changed `_extractAID()` to `_extractAIDs()` - now extracts **all** AIDs from PPSE
- ✅ Tries each AID sequentially until one succeeds
- ✅ No longer fails if first AID doesn't work

#### Known Payment AID Fallback
- ✅ Added `_tryKnownAIDs()` method with 10+ known payment AIDs:
  - Visa: Standard, Electron, Interlink, Plus
  - Mastercard: Standard, Maestro, Debit, Credit
  - RuPay: Standard, Domestic
- ✅ Automatically falls back to known AIDs if PPSE fails or all PPSE AIDs fail

#### Strict ISO 7816-4 Compliance
- ✅ Added Le byte (`00`) to all APDU commands:
  - SELECT AID: `00A4040007{AID}00` (was missing Le)
  - GPO: `80A800000283000000` (was `80A8000002830000`)
  - GPO with PDOL: `80A80000{LENGTH}83{PDOL_LENGTH}{PDOL_DATA}00`
  - READ RECORD: `00B2{RECORD}{SFI}00` (already had Le, kept consistent)
- ✅ Fixes error `6700` (Wrong length) on strict domestic cards

#### PPSE Failure Handling
- ✅ Wrapped PPSE selection in try-catch
- ✅ Gracefully handles cards that don't support PPSE
- ✅ Falls back to known AIDs if PPSE fails

#### Enhanced Debugging
- ✅ Enabled debug logging in `debug_logger.dart`
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at every step
- ✅ Logs all AIDs tried and which one succeeded
- ✅ Helps diagnose card-specific issues

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Domestic Card Support
- **Issue**: Axis Bank Priority Debit Card (Visa Platinum - Domestic) was failing with error `6700`
- **Root Cause**: Missing Le byte in APDU commands
- **Solution**: Added Le byte to all APDU commands
- **Result**: ✅ Now works with both international and domestic cards

#### Debit Card Scanning
- **Issue**: Debit cards were failing to scan (NFC detected but scanning failed)
- **Root Cause**: Only first AID was tried; many debit cards have multiple AIDs
- **Solution**: Extract and try all AIDs sequentially
- **Result**: ✅ Debit cards now scan successfully
